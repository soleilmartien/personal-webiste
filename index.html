                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a 18 year old student from Qu√©bec who is currently completing a pre-university degree in natural sciences. Next year,
                    I will begin my first year of a BSc in Computer Engineering, which will hopefully lead me to become a successful machine learning engineer.
                    My interest in computers was sparked when I was 9 and was gifted a Raspberry Pi by my father. I spent hours making fun games using Scratch, 
                    only to put aside this interest until now. I love playing classical guitar, going to the gym and learning about new things. I did not have any
                    programming experience prior to this course and was inspired to learn by HBO's Silicon Valley.

                <h1>Why did I choose this program?</h1>
                <p> Before starting this program, I could see that my life was beginning to be ruined by a powerful lethargy, self-destructive tendencies and a general lack of purpose.
                    Seeing this, I decided to quit my job as a beneficiary attendant and to spend all my savings into this course, my reasonning being that this would 
                    force me to complete this course, it being my only hope to financial reparation. Luckily for me, I was right! The constant anxiety of having wasted my only 
                    hope of sustaining myself with good pay during my higher education forced me to adapt: I kicked dope, started exercising, getting full slepp and eating better.
                    If everything goes well, I should have finished this course in a week. I hope to use my newly aquired skills as a full-stack developer 
                    to make some money as a freelancer during my pursuit of a bachelor's degree.
